Old Installers of Ultraschall.

These are NOT supported by us any longer. They are here only for historic reasons.
Use them at your own risk!

Some need specific Reaper-Versions to run!

The ReaperConfigZip-files must be dropped onto Reaper and imported and contain only an incomplete installation of Ultraschall.

Early 1.x-versions need Python additionally installed!
